HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTPS -> Secure HTTP
Anytime you visit a website which is https, secured and encrypted connection will be setup between you and the server.

===============================================
How do you test rest api?
 I verify if each REST API endpoint is working as expected.
I send GET, POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE type of requests and verify response status code and response body, header. I also do positive and negative testing of API.
 When I do positive testing, I send valid request parameters , valid headers, valid request json body and verify that response status code is 200 successful and Json response body data is also matching the expected.
 When I do negative testing, I send invalid request parameters , or invalid headers, or invalid request json body and verify that response status code is not 200 and Json response body contains error message.
 How does API Authentication work in your application ? I send a get request to special api endpoint with providing valid credentials (username,password or email,password), then it returns AccessToken. I use that token in my request header and access other api endpoints. I always send accesstoken with all of my requests through headers.
