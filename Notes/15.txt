  - Dynamic testing types == Software testing levels 
         - unit testing            unitleri test
         - Integration testing     toplu unitleri birlikte test
         - System testing           level 3 testerlerin yaptığı.
         - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)


 expected result == client's requirement 
 actual result == the output / actually result after performing testing


Static testing: testing documents , no coding , performed manually


Dynamic testing: testing code and software
                 performed manually & automatically 




Verification process : process of prepare documents, testing it(perform static testing) 


Validation process: process of write code, and test it (dynamic test)
                    
              e.g:  a frontend developer wrote code to build a login feature
                    then he/she performed dynamic testing to test the code 




who perform the static testing? 
    - whoever wrote a document, and all the people are related to the document.

    e.g: 1. in requirement gathering step, business team & client perform static testing 

         2.  in design step, designers and client, maybe business team also perform static testing 





automatic testing=computer basic testing(resimleri gözlerimizle kontrol ederiz bu manuel olabilir. Unitleri tek tek kontrol ederiz.
manually testing=                        bu manuel olabilir. Jenkinse atarız dosyaları bu automatice daha yakındır.Manuel is with no automation tools.)
