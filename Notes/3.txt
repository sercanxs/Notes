===============================
SDLC: 
     Software Development Life Cycle

     global standardized steps to develop softwares


0. Idea -> theme / domain of a software 

domain -> Bank domain 
          
            Bank of america 
            Chase bank 


          Education domain 
            Canvas 
            Udemy -> 

          health-care domain 
             UHG 
             highmark

           Game domain 

SDLC step1: Requirement Gathering 
             

             provide the requirement: 
             Client / customer ==> who own the business / idea / software

             internal customer - CEO, or anyone in the IT company get the idea

                    e.g: Kuzzat is a client for cybertekschool.com project

             external customer -> the idea / project belongs to a person or one company, but its build by another IT company 

                    e.g: Asiya - restaurant owner, the IT company is buiding her project 


                    e.g:  Cybertek is an external customer to replit/canvas/zoom/okta 


           who gather requirement : 
             Business team - Product Owner (PO) , Project manager (PM), Business Analysis (BA)


             what is a requirement: features of the software that will be developed/built 

             what is a feature of a app? 
                what the software can do ? what the users can do on the app? 

                e.g: Discord: communicate/chat 
                              user/account management -> add/delete/edit a user information    
                              channel 
                              file management 
                              log call -> voice message / video message

          


             How do business team organized the requirements? 
                - they write documents 
                - example doc - SRS 

           
           How do you know if a requirement is good or not? 

                - the requirement should be SMART 

SDLC Step2: Design 
              write SDS doc based on SRS 
              designers design forntend/backend 
              meanwhile they identify input/data to the app 

              All the documents are reviewed by business team and stakeholders



SDLC Step3: developing / coding / implementing 

             Developers ==frontend developers 
                          backend developers 
                          full-stack developers - (know both frontend & backend)


SDLC step4: Testing / validating / check quality 
           
            manual testers 

            automation testers = 
                          frontend testers 
                          backend testers 
                          full-stack testers - (know both frontend & backend)

             
             performance testers => speed , volume, stress,  
             security engineer 

             DevOps engineer -> 

             
             after all types of testings are done by different testing team,Client needs to approve the software  

SDLC step5: deploying / releasing / push to market / let end users use the app 
            
             end users use the app

SDLC step 6: maintaining 
             
              1. hidden bugs might be reported by end users 

              bug reports from end users will handled by the team who envolved on debveloping the app. 

              business team will check the bug reports and updated requirement
              developers fix the bugs --> hot fix 
              testers/QA --> test agian 

              2. testers might test the production as well 
                 PO/BA provide simulated data to testers

              3. support 

              4. update the app 
                 
                  what features I had so far: menu, review, favorite, payment

                  new idea : make reservation, pick up / dilivery , location


                 PO and his/her team will gather the new requirements from the CLient ==  back to SDLC step 1
