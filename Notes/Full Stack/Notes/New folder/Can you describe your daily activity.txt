Can you describe your daily activity? 
• My daily activities at work, Mostly, I go to work early in the morning and check result report of Smoke test to make sure 
that environment is up and running and the application is stable or not for the day. 
• If something goes wrong, I will send out an email to my team so they can take care of it asap before everyone comes to 
work, to reach maximum productivity. 
• And then I check my email if there are any important tasks or notices, also check my schedule if there are any meetings 
for the day and also check Jira to review what needs to be done that day in which priority. 
• Then I go to attend daily standup meeting with my scrum team to talk about what I did yesterday, what we will do today 
and are there any impediments in my way. This meeting takes about 15 minutes. 
• After that, I go back to my desk and start automating test cases from regression suits. And also, I automate test cases 
from sprint backlog after doing manually if it is passed. We are end of our sprint and we are finishing our automating, test 
execution, reporting, preparing for and conducting Sprint Demo 
• Also, once a week, we have Code Review meetings, to review the code. this is really helpful 
• Most fulfilling for me, is my mentoring sessions with junior testers or developers in which i train them on automation and 
sometimes non-technical skills. we do this as a brown bag lunch, and it really helps us increase our overall productivity, 
saving the company resources and money but also, gives us the valuable opportunity to get to know our coworkers and at 
the end of the day, the most important thing to me in my opinion, is the people I work with
