HTTP REQUESTS
GET --> retrieve, read data
POST --> create, insert data
PUT --> update the existing records, data in api
PATCH --> partial update of existing data
DELETE --> remove records from api

WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUT AND POST ?
we use POST method to create data in api for the FIRST TIME.Adding new students,customers,teachers,spartans
if we want to UPDATE existing data from api, we use PUT METHOD.

POST returns 201 most of the time (%99)
PUT might be 200 or 204 (up to developers)

WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUT AND PATCH ?
When we ure using PUT method, we have to send all parameters such as name,gender,phone even if we only
update one of them, but if we use PATCH we can only send the parameters(json key) that we want to update, we DO NOT
need to send rest of the keys.
