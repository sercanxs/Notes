======================
interview Q: 

what is a test plan? 
   - Doc 
   - there are several table of content like: intro to test plan, summary of the project, test strategy, scope of testing (list of the testing types), risk & mitigation, approvals, recourse .. 

   - in our scrum team, we have a test plan doc for each release 
   - our team lead responsible to create test plan doc 
     OR I create the test plan doc 


   - we implement Agile - scrum, so we do not have test plan doc (not recomended, but real example) 


do you have experience writing a test plan doc? 
 - yes or not is up to you 





who is your PM? 
- you have to give a name
