5. Retro meeting -> retrespective -> go back / reviewing 
            
                    SM and the dev team 

                    3 questions : 
                    1. What went well ? 
                    2. What went wrong? 
                    3. What could be done differentlly to make a improve? 

1 way to conduct retro: 
  SM gives 3 colored papers to the dev team 
     - red - What went wrong? 
     green - What went well ? 
    yellow - What could be done differently 


nother way to have retro: 
 - just answer the 3 questions by taking turns 



DOR -> definition of ready? 

deciding is a user story is "READY" to be selected in to Sprint backlog 


 - used in the sprint planning meeting

     
  - user story is already explianded by PO 
  - User story is INVEST 
  - estimated /sized 


Both DOD, DOR decided by the dev team & PO togather.
     When ? -> before starting to work on a new project . 
               So it is everyone's responsibility. 



before starting to work on a new project, before starting sprint 1, 
 the Scrum team & PO decide many things togather:

1. Sprint cycle 
2. Team name 
3. sprint starting date 
4. DOR & DOD lists 
5. Testing tools / languages to use 
6. framework types 
7. Scrum meeting times / frequency 
8. selecy a team leader  -> or PM already hired someone as team lead
