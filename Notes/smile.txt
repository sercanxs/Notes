interview'de gülmek sınavı geçirir.

On the other hand, generally I noticed most of us  are  missing an critical  point which is giving a positive impression to  interviewer, most of you look really  unhappy while giving answer. As a company I would not prefer to work with unhappy team member. Please try to be positive in the interview, please smile , please give your positive energy to interviewer. I know it is not easy to look happy while you have lots of problems in your life , but this is the reality no one prefers to work with someone who is looking demotivated or  unhappy . Please always remember they are  searching for teammates, they are looking for someone who will make them happy to work with.
