 Hi Sercan. Thanks for submitting your first flipgrid. You told about what is SDLC and briefly gave enough and correct information about all phases. For this question, it would be better to emphasize the importance of Requirement Gathering step, SRS Document and also SMART criteria. As you know, if we are not clear on what to do, it won't be possible to do our job correctly. It will directly affect all the rest phases of SDLC.
