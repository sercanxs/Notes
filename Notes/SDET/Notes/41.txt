   Scrum 3 artifacts :  1. Product backlog
   							there is one only PB for one project 
                             PO owns th PB 
                             PO stores the Users stories , other tasks
                             PO prioritize the stories 
                             any changes for req is welcome 


                        2. Sprint backlog
                        	there are many SB 
                        	for each sprint, we have 1 SB
                        	changes are not welcome 
                        	SM and dev team use / manage the SB



    



Grooming meeting --> 
            Before the Grooming: PO write/prepare user stories & its AC 
            					 PO prioritize stories  
                                 Stories are stored in product backlog

            During the Grooming: Scrum team = SM, PO , Dev team
                                 PO explains the Stories & ACs 

                                 Estimate story points (optional)



Who decide the story points? 

1. PO ask to give points, and Developers & testers give points

2. PO & Developers give points (there is no testers involved estimation)






 Jira is app/software that IT companies use to manage project- work hours, documents like user story, bug report, test cases, test results, sprint activities, and scrum artifacts. 



Sprint planing : conducted in the 1st day of sprint

During the sprint planning: 
    Step1: SM creates a sprint backlog in Jira 
    Step2: How many story points we can finish in this sprint? 
         - SM asked each person's availability for the sprint
         - SM ask question "do you have any day off? "
             Original team capacity : [ (dev num + QA num) * 8 days ] 

         - based on that , calculated the team's capacity 
   Step3: PO/BA takes the stories from backlog to sprint backlog 
   Step4: start the sprint 
           - SM click the button "Start sprint" on jira 
           - SM /PO write sprint Goal , choose the sprint starting & ending dat 








sprint backlog -> exact tasks (stories, bug..) needs to be done during the current sprint 
                 1 SB per sprint
                 SM created SB in the sprint planning meeting 




How many stories a team can finish in a sprint? 
- this is a wrong question. 

How many story points we can finish in a sprint? 


 1 sprint == 2 weeks == 10 days 

     Dev team can work on user stories only in 8 days. 

    1st day of each sprint - planning meeting, analze user stories, assign task
    last day-> Demo meeting 

    






who transfers them from product backlog to spritn backlog???
- PO 
- Could be BA 
- OR SM ? ?
