When I give you a story, can you tell me how will you test it in your framework? 

- Framework name -> Cucumber BDD -> behavior driven development 
                  
                   why? 1. 3 amigos - BA/DEV/QA -> non-tech can understand 
                        2. test a function from all 3 layers - ui/db/api
                        3. easy to maintain  & non duplicate code 


- build management tool -> Maven 
- major programming langues is -> Java 

- POM.xml file --> manage dependencies + plugins (for the reports)

- configuration.properties -> it is KEY - VALUE format file 
                             store project data, to centralize data 

- in my framework, i have a resource with a features folder: 
     
     - create 1 feature file -> 1 user story 

          - to write scenario + scenario outline with Gherkin language

- I have a package called - Step_definition  
     
     - to write my test script (code) + with the correspond testing tools - selenium, jdbc, or restAssured + junit 

     - Hooks class -> store before & after methods 


- I have a runner package : 
   
    - cukesRunner class -> it is an empity class 
                           use @Runwith [from Junit] 
                               @cucumberOptions from cucumber 
                           
                            setup options: 
                              1. provide feature file location 
                              2. glue it with Step-definition

                               I can select which feature / scenario to run:
                              3. tag 
                              4. DryRrun 

                              very importantly :
                              5. plugin for reports - html, json, rerun for fails

                                 all the reports -> Target Package  

- I have a utill package: many reusable methods 
    
      for example: config.reader -> a class + inputStream

       developers may provide most used SQL queries to the QAs: queries 

                  BrowserUtil -> so many methods - that I and other QAs created 

- I have designed our framework with several design pattern: 
       
        1. Singleton -> under the utill - called Driver -> to create just 1 drover object 

        2. POM - page object design -> pages package 
              1 page class per page of our project 
                   locate each webelemnts with @FindBy (Selenium)
                   use pageFactory + initElement() 

        3. POJO -> API class 

        4. Abstraction -> abstract class ->basePage -> we do not need to create object of the class, just store common elements for all pages


optional : 
- big data -> data package 
   
    data in excel -> Apache POI 

==========================

how many framework do you have in your project? 

-1. 1 cucumber framework -> all the 3 layers 
        
         UI_featutrs packages
         DB_featutrs packages 
        API_featutrs packages


-2. 2 framework for the UI & backend 
        UI cucumber framework 
        backEnd (cucumber) framework 






name convention : 

1, project / package names -> lower case
   class name -> upper case 
   method name -> lower case + verb 

   feature file name -> the same function + which layer 

        loginFeature_UI
        loginFeature_API
        loginFeature_DB
