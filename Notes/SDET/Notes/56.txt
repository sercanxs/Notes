STLC- Bug life cycle 

--------------------

Test case -> describing what to test ? how to test? 
           

             
   

        test case description == test scenario == test case summary _. what to test 

               e.g: 
			      - login as a admin -> scenario
			      - login as a student -> scenario
			      - login as a mentor -> scenario

       








As a user, I want to login to the app. 

    AC: login button should be displayed on the page under the password input box 
        username box should be displayed
        password box should be displayed


      - login as a admin  -> positive 
      - login as a student -> positive 
      - login as a mentor -> positive 
      - login with invalid username  ---> negative 
      - login without username or password  --> negative 
      - login with invalid password  --> negative



Test case example: 
  test case ID: can01 
  test scenario : login as a admin 
  test environemtn : qa env -> http://qa.canvas.com/login
  test data : username: admin01, admin02. admin23 
              password: 123abc

  test steps: 
             step1: user go to login page
             step2: user enter username & password
             step3: user click login button
             step4: verify that user login succuessfully and launched on the home page - system display 5 modules

Are we the one that divide the user story to different scenarios or somebody will tell us which scenarios to test?

    - most of time, qa/sdet create Test cases for his/her user story alone 

    - in some company, there are BA who will do it togather.

        - after sprint planning meeting, BA and testers have a meeting to analyze test scenarios for all the user stories that should be completed within the sprint.  -> meeting name could be: test scenario review 







when we test our test cases, do we have to check them in different devices?(Iphone, Ipad, Laptop, Desktop, etc...)??? 

    - it depends on your project request 
    - normally you need to test with 2-3 browsers 











===================

Gherkin language, several key words used in test case steps: 

     Given -> the page that user should be 
             Given user on the forgot password page

     When  -> use it in the action 
               When user enter email 

     And -> extra actions
              And user click retrieve password button 

     Then --> result or verification part 
              Then verify the confirmation message displays



test case manual steps: 
user go to forgot password page 
user enter email & click the button
verify the confirmation message 


Given user on the forgot password page
When user enter email 
And user click retrieve password button 
Then verify the confirmation message displays

bug life cycle -> start testing == test execution 
                  found a valid bug -> have to perform the testing with at least 3 differetn data & different env if possible to confirm 

                  New bug 

                  bug report 

                  assign the bug report to someone 

                  open the bug 

                  fix 

                  pospone - deferred == fix the bug later 

                  I will re-test the bug after it's fixed 

                      - has fixed? -> done 
                      - still has issue / bug? /not fixed --> re-assign to dev 


                   dev might reject the bug -> 1. invalid 2. duplicated
