What is computer vision?

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images, and extraction 
of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the form of decisions.
"Understanding" in this context signifies the transformation of visual images (the input to the retina) into descriptions of the 
world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling 
of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.
