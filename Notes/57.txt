                Test data -> where do you get your test data? 
                            
                            1. I use dummy data website to generate 

                            2. sometimes I got data from my developer/BA for the valid data

                            3. some company has "data provider" team  - not common
                            

                 
                How do you eveluate if a test case is a good or bad? 
                    - a test case should have all the neseceary elements -id, scenario, test data, pre-condition, test env, and test steps , expected result. 

                    - test steps should written in detail 

               



Test environment -> dev env func should be deployed to QA env. 
                    Done by DevOps team with Jenkins app. 


                   
                UI testing : 

                manual testing -> 

                                  no matter pass or fail, need to provide evidance 
                                   - screenshot, screenvideo 


               atomation testing -> 
                                    - recomened take a screenshot of IDE result 




test cycle closure -> in agile, if i am done with the user story ? 

                      - all the test cases are executed 
                      - any bug report is written , bug is removed 


                      is this sprint's user stories are all done? 

                      - demo meeting at the end of the sprint - PO 

                      - team lead & business team analyze some reports from the sprint 
                         sprint report -> how many stories are completed 
                                          how much % of manual vs automation 
                                          each member's time spent on testing
